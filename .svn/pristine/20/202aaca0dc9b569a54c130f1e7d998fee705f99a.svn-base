            <p>Today we have finished close beta testing of macOS version.
                Thank you all for your help and time to give us feedback.
                It's all highly appreciated! There's still lots of work to do,
                thus Opera GX both on macOS and Windows are still both in early access.
                You can read more about the new build on our blog along with some
                interesting findings about gamers. In addition we have designed
                new wallpapers to make Opera GX look even better. Head over
                to the gallery and check them out....
                There are two brand new features in this update: Network Limiter
                and Release Calendar. Let's start with Network Limiter. You will
                find it in the GX Control panel along with CPU and Memory Limiter.
                It allows you to set the maximum download and upload speed that Opera GX can achieve.
                Values are expressed in MB/s and KB/s which is pretty reasonable measurement
                when we're talking about download and upload. However when you perform network
                speed tests (for instance: speedtest.net) results are expressed in Mbps and Kbps,
                which are bits not bytes. There are 8 bits in each byte so 1 MB/s = 8 Mbps...
